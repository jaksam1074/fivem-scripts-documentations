# Nothing is fixing the errors

### I followed all steps but nothing is working, what can I do?

If you have followed all steps, there are few remaining possibilities: <br>

1. You have to wait some time (around 30 minutes)
2. You didn't follow the guide correctly, in this case you have to read the guide again carefully
3. If you are 100% sure that you followed the guide correctly but you still have errors from escrow system, you will need to contact [FiveM support](https://discord.gg/fivem), because these kind of errors are not caused by the scripts but by the FiveM asset escrow system, so the scripts developer can't help about these errors
